# Challenge #6 - HTML and CSS ðŸ’»

From [the Explore programming scholl](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/explorer) by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

## About the challenge

In thisÂ challenge, IÂ had toÂ put into practice everything I learned about HTML and CSS:
- Start your project taking into account the mobile-first rule, as you can see, in the layout we already have the responsive application too;
- You can add animations, transitions, and transformations at your discretion;
- It would be cool if you started the project using flexible measurement units (rem);
- You can use variables in CSS to train;
- Look carefully at accessibility: take care of the semantics of your HTML.
